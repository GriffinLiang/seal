# SEAL: Semantic Enhanced Attribute Learning
SEAL is a PyTorch-based attribute learning package designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of attribute learning models. SEAL is designed to offer a flexible and modular framework for building attribute learning models. It leverages semantic information and uses state-of-the-art techniques to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the learned attributes.

## News üöÄ
*August 4, 2023*: One paper accepted in ACM MM 2023: **Hierarchical Visual Attribute Learning in the Wild**. The relevant code will be updated soon.

## Installation 

Here's how you can get started with SEAL:

1. Clone the repo and install:

```
git clone https://github.com/PRIS-CV/seal.git
cd /path/to/seal
pip install -e .
```


2. Import the models and start building attribute learning pipelines.

## Download

### Download VAW and VG Dataset
Download VAW dataset at https://github.com/adobe-research/vaw_dataset

Download VG v1.4 dataset at https://visualgenome.org/

### Download Word-embedding
You need to download relevant word embeddings at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18M4F7vA0EOZqlp88E4W9gatQUTcSHYd6?usp=sharing), and put it under `data/embeddings/`.

### Clean The VAW Dataset
Use `clean.ipynb` in `notebook/` to clean the original VAW dataset to get cleaned VAW dataset.


### A Demo of Running a Project

Before running you should check the modular json settings in a project's directory, e.g., `projects/gsl`:

```bash

python main.py --project projects/gsl --mode train

python main.py --project projects/gsl --mode test

```
