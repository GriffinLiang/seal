# SEAL: Semantic Enhanced Attribute Learning
SEAL is a PyTorch-based attribute learning package designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of attribute learning models. SEAL is designed to offer a flexible and modular framework for building attribute learning models. It leverages semantic information and uses state-of-the-art techniques to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the learned attributes.

## News üöÄ

*August 24, 2023*: One paper accepted in ACM MM 2023: **Hierarchical Visual Attribute Learning in the Wild**. The relevant code is now available. Please see project [osarn](projects/osarn/README.md)

*August 18, 2023*: Add HVAW dataset in `seal/dataset/hvaw.py`. Add new evaluation metric `CV`, `CmAP` and update the evaluation system.


## Plan üìã
*Distributed Mode* We will soon update distributed training and inference.

## Installation 

Here's how you can get started with SEAL:

1. Clone the repo and install:

```
git clone https://github.com/PRIS-CV/seal.git
cd /path/to/seal
pip install -e .
```


2. Import the models and start building attribute learning pipelines.


## Docs and Tutorial üìö

A brief [architecture overview](seal/README.md) assists users in quickly grasping the structure of SEAL.

## Running

Before running you should check the modular json settings in a project's directory, e.g., `projects/gsl` and see the running instruction in each project's README file:

```bash

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --project projects/gsl --mode train

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --project projects/gsl --mode test

```

## Citation

If you use SEAL in your research or project, please consider citing the relevant papers.
